### SCRIPT HISTORY FOR CONFLUENCE GWAS ###

### SELECT CASES/CONTROLS ###
# in phenotype/
# select all breast cancer individuals, subset by gender
select_breast_cancer.sh 

# select non cancer controls 
select_non_cancer.sh 

# select females with breast cancer AND without other invasive cancer
select_confluence.sh 

### IMPUTED DATA GRAFANC ANCESTRY ###
# extracting acnestry snps from each chunk with ExtractAncSnpsFromVcfGz.pl
nano grafanc_extract_chunks.bsub

# checking size/stats of each chunk - didn't really use this 
# grafanc_extract_chunks_check.bsub

# only chr22 test first - archive 
# grafanc_merge_chunks_chr22.bsub

# for some reason chr2 and 3 chunks are the wrong order for samples, but it's just them 
# so match the order of chr1 
imputed/chunked_vcf/grafanc_fix_chr2_3.sh

# to check order of each file, should prob make this array based to be faster 
bcftools view ancestry_snps_chr1_chunk1.vcf.gz | grep '^#CHROM' | cut -f10- | tr '\t' '\n' | head -n 10

# merge all chunks together - too large, not enough disk space
# grafanc_merge_chunks.bsub

# merge together vcf by chromosome, convert to plink to save disk space 
grafanc_merge_chr.bsub

# merge chr plink 
grafanc_merge_all_chr.bsub 

# grafanc has 282425 AncSnpPopAFs
# merged ancestry_chr_all has 303890 snps, but 13640 have same position 
 
# actually run grafanc on all
bsub < grafanc_run.bsub

### GRAFANC RESULT ANALYSIS  ###
# for entire pmbb, compare with covar files and person self-reported race and ethnicity files
# un grafanc_results
grafanc_check.sh 

# then check for our bresat cancer gwas speciifc cases/controls
grafanc_check_breast.sh
# seemed alright the ancestry inference, so we can keep going

### COMMON SNPS ###
# subset to cases and controls 
# adds phenotype and sex data
# check individual missingness 0.05 
# removes ppl 3sd +/- heterozygsootiy 
# checks relatedness- nobody related
all_ind_qc.sh

# subsets genotype file into ancestry, performs preprocesing on each group by individual level  
bash ancestry_ids.sh 

# from now on use array jobs for each ancestry
# perform variant level qc on each ancestry group 
bsub < ancestry_variant_qc.bsub
# can set cleanup to yes or no 

# perform pca for each ancesetry 
# preps covariates, phenotypes, sample list files
bsub < ancestry_prep_step1.bsub 

# actually perform step 1 bruh 
bsub < ancestry_step1.bsub

# finally bruh
bsub < ancestry_step2.bsub
